# References and inspiration

I got inspired by the following projects:
- [self-operating-computer](https://github.com/OthersideAI/self-operating-computer/tree/main)
- [speech-to-speech](https://github.com/huggingface/speech-to-speech/tree/main)

The reason I don't fork them is that my vision is slightly different, and I want to learn how to create such system from scratch.
